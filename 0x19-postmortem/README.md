Duration: The outage occurred from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM on May 10, 2024 (UTC).
Impact: The outage affected the authentication service, rendering it inaccessible for all users attempting to log in during the outage window. Approximately 30% of users were unable to access the service during this time.
Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was identified as a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings, leading to an overload on the authentication service servers.
Timeline:

10:00 AM: The issue was detected through monitoring alerts indicating a spike in server response times.
10:05 AM: Engineers began investigating the issue, initially suspecting a database overload.
10:30 AM: Misleading investigation paths led to the incorrect assumption of database issues, prompting further investigation.
11:00 AM: After ruling out database issues, attention shifted to the load balancer configuration.
11:30 AM: The incident was escalated to the infrastructure team for further investigation and resolution.
12:30 PM: The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings was identified and corrected, restoring normal service functionality.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The misconfiguration in the load balancer settings led to an uneven distribution of traffic to the authentication service servers, causing some servers to become overloaded while others remained underutilized.
Resolution: The load balancer settings were adjusted to evenly distribute incoming traffic among all authentication service servers, ensuring optimal performance and preventing server overload.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Implement automated monitoring for load balancer configurations to detect anomalies promptly.
Conduct regular audits of load balancer settings to identify and rectify potential misconfigurations.
Tasks to Address the Issue:
Implement automated load balancer configuration validation checks.
Conduct load testing to simulate and identify potential overload scenarios in advance.
Enhance documentation and training for infrastructure team members on load balancer management best practices.
This postmortem highlights the importance of thorough monitoring and prompt investigation in resolving service outages. By implementing corrective measures and preventive tasks, we aim to minimize the risk of similar incidents in the future and ensure uninterrupted service delivery to our users.


Title: The Great Authentication Apocalypse: A Tale of Load Balancer Misadventures

Issue Summary:

Duration: Witness the chaos unfold from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM on May 10, 2024 (UTC).
Impact: The authentication service played hide-and-seek, leaving 30% of users locked out during the outage.
Root Cause: Like a villainous puppeteer, a misconfigured load balancer pulled the strings, leading to server overload woes.
Timeline:

10:00 AM: The silent alarms blared as monitoring tools sensed trouble in server paradise.
10:05 AM: Engineers donned their Sherlock hats and embarked on a quest for answers, initially suspecting foul play in the database realm.
10:30 AM: Alas! The database was as innocent as a newborn lamb. The hunt continued.
11:00 AM: With confusion mounting, suspicions turned towards the load balancer, the elusive mastermind behind the scenes.
11:30 AM: The cavalry arrived in the form of the infrastructure team, ready to tackle the load balancer labyrinth.
12:30 PM: Victory! The load balancer's mischievous ways were vanquished, restoring order to the authentication kingdom.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The load balancer, in a mischievous mood, decided to play favorites, overloading some servers while leaving others twiddling their thumbs.
Resolution: With a wave of the magical configuration wand, balance was restored to the load balancer universe, ensuring equal server love for all.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
